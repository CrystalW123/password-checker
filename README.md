# password-checker

The python file contains code that checks whether your password has been used before from this [API](https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/)

The way it works is that it takes any argument passed to it when running the file, the argument can be a single password or multiple passwords and then returns how many times the password has been used before in different places and either suggests for you to change it or keep the password. So on your terminal you would run **python passwordchecker.py whatever-password**.
